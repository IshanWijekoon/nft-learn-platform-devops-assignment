## Merge Conflict Resolution

To demonstrate real-world collaboration, our team intentionally created
a merge conflict in README.md by modifying the same section from two
different feature branches.

The conflict was resolved by reviewing both changes and combining them
into a final version that represents the whole team’s contribution.
